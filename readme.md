There was compared two types of searching in graphs: Depth-first search, Breadth-first search. In the result, pathes of Depth-first search start from target point and then to its neighbor and for now this neighbor is the start, that continue still the most depth element would be visited, after that return to the next neighbor of target point. At the same time, Breadth-first search firstly visit all neighbors of target point and only after that go next. That is why the results are diferent.
